# Variable Scope
# Variables have different scopes depending on where they're defined:

# Global variables:
#    Globbal var are the variable which can access every where in program

# Local variables:
#    Local var are the variable which can access only in the block not accessed outside the block

global_var = "I'm global"  # Global variable

def my_function():
    local_var = "I'm local"  # Local variable
    print(global_var)  # Can access global variables
    print(local_var)   # Can access local variables

my_function()

print(global_var)  # Works
print(local_var)   # Raises NameError: name 'local_var' is not defined

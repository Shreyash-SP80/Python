# Used for mathematical operations:

a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)   # Addition: 13
print(a - b)   # Subtraction: 7
print(a * b)   # Multiplication: 30
print(a / b)   # Division: 3.333...
print(a // b)  # Floor division (quotient without remainder): 3
print(a % b)   # Modulus (remainder): 1
print(a ** b)  # Exponentiation (a to the power b): 1000
print(-a)      # Unary minus: -10
print(+a)      # Unary plus: 10 (doesn't change value)

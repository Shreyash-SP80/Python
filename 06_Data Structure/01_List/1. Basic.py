
# - A list is an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items that can contain elements of different data types
# - Lists are mutable (can be changed after creation)
# - Can contain mixed data types
# - Support nested lists (lists within lists)
# - Shallow vs deep copying matters for nested lists
# - Lists are ordered (maintain insertion order)

# Creating a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']  # List of strings
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]               # List of integers
mixed = [1, 'hello', 3.14, True]        # Mixed data types
empty = []                              # Empty list
